## Chrome extension - switch to mono, stereo audio channel layout for a video ##

This is an unpacked Google Chrome extension which:
  - creates an `AudioContext` with a single channel so that you can no longer be frustrated when a YouTube video plays in only one ear.

##  Basic flow ##
When you first click the extension button, Mono is toggled.
On second click, your maximum number of channels per device destination is restored to its initial value.
